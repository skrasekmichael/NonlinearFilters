# Nonlinear Filters
**Bachelor's thesis**

Topic: Nonlinear denoising filters for 3D filtration (Bilateral filter, Non-local means filter). 

## Milestones
- 2D Bilateral filter (naive implementation) ✔
- Fast 2D Bilateral filter (custom optimizations) ✔
- Fast 2D Bilateral filter (aproximation, other optimizaions ...)
- 2D Non-local means filter (naive implementation)

...
- 3D Bilateral filter
- 3D Non-local means filter?
